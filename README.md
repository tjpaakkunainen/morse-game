# morse-game
Hello!

I remember learning morse code in the army and it was great fun. Now I'm learning Python
so this can only be double fun.

I will occasionally spend a few moments to further this trivial game, which, when finished, should allow users to
practice morse code by 

1. Converting morse characters to normal 
2. Converting normal characters to morse
3. Input morse code by pressing keys (dit dah dit dit!) and have the program translate it
4. Play morse characters (sound) and user can guess them
5. Solve challenges by converting given strings to morse. Or something

Program may even input a sound when key is pressed.

Identified open questions:

    1. What is the best way to input morse code (currently thinking timing keypresses)
    2. How to define short keypress and long keypress? Should there be different speed levels?
    3. How to make system do sound? (probably easy)
    4. How to make system do sound on keypress? (probably slightly harder)
    5. Does this all work together with no latency? (probably hard?)

Also, should probably read at least the wikipedia entry on Morse code at some point.
