# morse-game

Will occasionally spend a few moments to further this trivial game, which, when finished, should allow users to
practice morse code by a) converting morse characters to normal, b) converting normal characters to morse, c) input morse code by pressing keys and have the program translate it, d) solve challenges by converting given strings to morse. Program may even input a sound when key is pressed.

Identified open questions:
    1. What is the best way to input morse code (currently thinking timing keypresses)
    2. How to define short keypress and long keypress? Should there be different speed levels?
    3. How to make system do sound on keypress? (probably easy)
    4. Does this all work together with no latency? (probably hard?)
